# DevFlow - Workflow Intelligence

Modular workflow system for AI coding assistants. Provides 9 skills for daily productivity and feature development across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex CLI.

## When to Apply

Reference these skills when:
- Starting/ending your workday
- Managing tasks and notes
- Developing new features (requirements → design → implementation)
- Generating work logs
- Initializing project workspace

## Skill Categories

| Category | Skills | Priority | Domain |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Workflow | standup, wrap, note, task, init | HIGH | productivity |
| Development | spec, arch, dev, flow | CRITICAL | feature-dev |

## Quick Reference

### Workflow Skills (Daily Use)

- standup - Daily startup: sync code, review tasks
- wrap - End of day: check uncommitted code, generate work log
- note - Quick notes: capture ideas during work
- task - Task management: create, list, complete tasks
- init - Project initialization: create workspace

### Development Skills (Feature Development)

- spec - Requirements analysis: understand, clarify, score completeness
- arch - Solution design: tech selection, module design, tradeoffs
- dev - Implementation: task breakdown, execution with checkpoints
- flow - Full automation: spec → arch → dev in one command

## How to Use

See [README.md](./README.md) for complete documentation.
